Smoke test for services.ai_variance_narratives

Why this exists:
- We want coverage without calling any external LLM APIs.
- Many repos provide a pure-Python fallback (rule-based) for variance narratives.
- If a helper like `generate_variance_summary` exists, we call it.
- If not, we still import the module (import-time coverage) and skip the tight call.

What it covers:
- Module import
- Preferred: a direct call into a pure function that returns a short narrative string
- Safe: never touches network; we scrub env vars to disable any cloud calls

    Arrange:
      - Clear API keys so any LLM path is disabled.
    Act:
      - Import the module and attempt to call a likely rule-based helper:
        * generate_variance_summary / summarize_variance / build_variance_narrative
    Assert:
      - If helper exists: it returns a non-empty string.
      - Otherwise: module import succeeds (import-time coverage), and we soft-skip.
